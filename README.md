# The Journey
## This project was made with what i was able to pickup in 2 days with a react couse on udemy.
- I faced a couple of difficulties but nothing too big.
- Here they are - 
```
$ I dont know how to use react-router plus it doesn't play well with github pages so i was not able to get a proper page header working.
$ Parallax did not work as intended for the starting portion
$ Had some react-router components which broke the website when deploying to github pages so had to remove those... sadge
```
- And ofcourse managing time during the 2 days to get this project up and working but some anime music (Giorno's theme) , and coffee got me through that 
- I went for comic like feel throughout the project and hopefully that shows.
- Other than that, this as a fun project to work on and i would put more time into it but i have stuff happening for the remaining majority of the week so nothing too big maybe a couple of minor changes.
- I will focus on more of what react offers for now , and at the same time getting more comfortable with css because css is very iffy
- Here is the [Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) btw
